# projection-space-explorer-app
The default app implementation for the projection-space-explorer library.

## Installation

First clone this repository, preferably using ssh.

```
git clone https://github.com/jku-vds-lab/projection-space-explorer-app.git
```

After this step you can install the dependencies using

```
npm install
```

Run the application with the following command

```
npm run start
```

Note that PSE has several peer dependencies which also need to be installed (material ui, react, reactdom etc). Either look them up in the package.json and install them, or use a library which automatically manages that.
